Ruby-File-Handling
==================

This is your assignment for file-handling, exception-handling, debugger, regular expression.

"You all create a file and insert some words(min 10 lines which contains alpha-numeric values) using user input. Then the data will save in the file and output will show like data is saved in that 'file-name'. After that u will take an input from the user and find the input in the file using regular expression and the output will be when data found it should tell the user the line no. + word no. in that line. If it not found any input it raise an exception and you will handle that exception and simply print that input data not found. After that traverse each line and find (using regular expression) which line contains numeric values and print the line and only numbers."
